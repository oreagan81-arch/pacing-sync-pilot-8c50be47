# Project Memory

## Core
- Thin Client React (Zustand) frontend, GAS backend via `VITE_GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL`, Supabase proxy (`gas-dispatch`) for deployment POSTs.
- Supabase anonymous auth. Single-user teacher environment.
- Canvas base URL: `thalesacademy.instructure.com`. Sanitize trailing slashes in Edge Functions.
- Dark theme ('Command Center' slate) with blue accents, DM Sans font. Statuses: Emerald (success), Amber (sync), Red (alerts/orphans).
- Friday Rules (mandatory): no At Home, no homework assignments (Tests OK), `create_assign=false`; reminder announcements may post Friday 4 PM ET.
- All deployments MUST include `published: true` on PUT if page is `front_page: true`.
- Math Test rows always deploy as Triple: Written Test + Fact Test (same day) + Study Guide (due day-1, synthetic, omit_from_final).
- Language Arts: only `CP` and `Test` rows create assignments; prefix `ELA4A`; course `21944`. DB trigger enforces.
- All generators (assignment titles, page titles, announcement phrases, file names) follow Memory > Templates > AI precedence via `src/lib/memory-resolver.ts`.
